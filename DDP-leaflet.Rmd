## Welcome to My Interactive Map Page!

This web page was created as part of an assignment to demonstrate the use of Leaflet for creating interactive maps in R Markdown. Below is an example of an interactive map that I created.

### Interactive Map

```{r, echo=FALSE}
# Load required libraries
library(leaflet)

# Create a simple Leaflet map
leaflet() %>%
  addTiles() %>%
  setView(lng = -93.85, lat = 37.45, zoom = 4) %>% 
  addMarkers(lng = -93.85, lat = 37.45, popup = "Welcome to the Center of the U.S.!")
