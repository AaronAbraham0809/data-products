### Interactive Map

```{r leaflet-map, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# Load the required library
library(leaflet)

# Create and render the Leaflet map
leaflet() %>%
  addTiles() %>%  # Add the default OpenStreetMap tiles
  setView(lng = -93.85, lat = 37.45, zoom = 4) %>%  # Set the initial view
  addMarkers(lng = -93.85, lat = 37.45, popup = "Welcome to the Center of the U.S.!")
